\section{Introduction}
\begin{onecolentry}
    I am a System Engineer and Tech Lead serving as the single point of contact for company infrastructure, responsible for end-to-end setup and operations from A to Z. With deep expertise in infrastructure architecture, virtualization, and distributed systems, I have built and managed the entire company infrastructure stack independently, including Proxmox VE clusters, network security, identity management, and storage systems. As the infrastructure owner, I excel at architecting scalable systems from scratch, optimizing performance, and ensuring high availability and reliability across all layers. My experience spans from low-level infrastructure management (VM isolation, VLAN configuration, colocation) to high-level system design (load balancing, caching strategies, hot/cold/warm archive storage). I am passionate about building robust, efficient systems that drive business success.
