        \item \textbf{Order Processing Platform:} Built comprehensive order processing system (Golang, gRPC, DDD) for supply chain domain. Purpose: Handle high-frequency orders from multiple e-commerce platforms (Shopee, Lazada, TikTok) with inventory versioning, automated retry mechanisms, and PDF invoice generation.
        \item \textbf{On-Prem IDC Infrastructure:} Designed and operate complete infrastructure platform (Proxmox VE, Kubernetes, NAS storage, networking). Purpose: Provide scalable, cost-effective on-premises infrastructure with VM isolation, HA (failover), automated provisioning, and backup-based system restoration.
        \item \textbf{Storage Tiering System:} Implemented hot/warm/cold archive storage strategy with NAS systems. Purpose: Optimize data lifecycle management, reduce storage costs by 40\%, and ensure efficient data access patterns.
        \item \textbf{Database Replication Platform:} Configured MySQL/PostgreSQL replication (master-slave, multi-master). Purpose: Ensure high availability, data consistency, and zero-downtime database operations.
        \item \textbf{Security Infrastructure:} Architected zero-trust security platform (Cloudflare ZeroTrust, secure tunnels, DDoS protection, WAF). Purpose: Protect company infrastructure and applications from threats while enabling secure remote access.
        \item \textbf{SRE Platform:} Built comprehensive SRE infrastructure (monitoring, HA architecture with failover). Purpose: Achieve 99.9\% uptime SLA, automate incident response, and ensure system reliability.
        \item \textbf{CI/CD Platform:} Developed automated deployment pipelines (GitHub Actions, Drone CI, Kubernetes). Purpose: Enable rapid, reliable software delivery with automated testing and deployment.

Purpose: Virtualize company infrastructure, enable rapid VM provisioning (80\% faster setup), and provide high-availability virtualization platform with automatic failover.
        \item \textbf{Kubernetes Platform:} Automated deployment of k8s/k3s clusters (Ansible playbooks) with Longhorn persistent storage. Purpose: Enable container orchestration for microservices, manage stateful applications, and provide scalable container platform.
        \item \textbf{Zero-Trust Network:} Architected company-wide secure network (DrayTek firewalls, Headscale VPN with Tailscale/WireGuard). Purpose: Establish unified zero-trust environment, secure remote access, and protect internal services.
        \item \textbf{Identity Provider Platform:} Implemented Authentik as centralized IdP (RBAC, SSO, MFA). Purpose: Secure internal services, enforce role-based access control, and provide single sign-on experience.
        \item \textbf{High-Frequency Order System:} Engineered order processing system (Golang cron, 5-min intervals) with API integrations (Shopee, Lazada, TikTok), Redis caching, webhook architecture, distributed locking. Purpose: Process orders in real-time, reduce API calls, and prevent duplicate processing.
        \item \textbf{API Platform:} Developed Golang API system with Swagger/Scalar documentation and API gateway. Purpose: Provide clear, documented APIs with rate limiting (50 RPM/client), reduce platform API consumption by 85\%, achieve 15ms response time for cached requests.
        \item \textbf{Performance Optimization:} Implemented Redis caching, load balancing, and monitoring systems. Purpose: Improve system throughput by 50\%, reduce response times, and optimize resource utilization.
        \item \textbf{CI/CD Platform:} Built CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Drone CI) for automated K8s deployments. Purpose: Enable rapid, reliable software delivery with automated testing and infrastructure as code.
        \item \textbf{Backup \& Restore System:} Established automated backup procedures and restoration capabilities for VMs, databases, and application data. Purpose: Enable system restoration from backups, ensure data protection, and support recovery operations.
        \item \textbf{Security Platform:} Configured Cloudflare and NGINX for load balancing and security (DDoS protection, WAF). Purpose: Protect applications from attacks, distribute traffic, and block malicious requests.
